Now we work for the oil production company. We need to decide where to drill the new well.
We follow several steps to make our recos:
- In a selected region, characteristics for wells are collected: oil quality and volume of its reserves;
- Build a model to predict the volume of reserves in new wells;
- The wells with the highest value estimates are selected;
The region with the maximum total profit of the selected wells is determined.
We have oil samples in three regions. The characteristics for each well in the region are already known. 
We analyze the potential rewards and risks using the Bootstrap.
