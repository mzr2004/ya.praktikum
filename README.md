# ya.praktikum

Hello and thank you for entering my repository!

My name is Marat Zastavnichenko and I'm a (to be) Data Scientist
Here you can find some of the most interesting projects I made with the help of Yandex.Praktikum on-line school.

You will find the description of each project in Read-me file for the respective folder.
You can also notice that project folders are having numbering order - this is the order of projects becoming more complex.

Kind regards and have a good day!

| # | Project name                                                | Project overview | Key libraries used |
|---| ---                                                         |---               | ---                |
|1  |Research analysis - apartment prices                         |In this project our main task is to define metrics that influence the apartments prices most. We mainly use visualization tools and correlation analysis to figure out influencing features | `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib` |        
|2  |Statistical analysis - phone tariff plans                    | In this project we as analyst of telekom company have to understand what tariff plan out of two brings company more money. During the project we also use statistical hypothetis to assess if the difference is statistically significant.| `scipy`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib` |
|3  |Analytical analysis - most popular games                     |Now we as analytics of internet store that sells computer games have to assess which games should we support in upcoming year. For that we analize what factors influence future sales most, i.e. be it a critics reviews, special ratings, etc.| `scipy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib` |
|4  |Machine learning intro - phone tariff plans                  | We are back to analysing data of most popular tariffs (see project #2). But now we are building recommendation system of most suitable tarif, so a machine learning categorization algorithm. | `sklearn.tree`, `sklearn.ensemble`, `sklearn.linear_model`, `sklearn.model_selection`, `sklearn.preprocessing`, `sklearn.metrics`, `joblib ` |
|5  |Machine learning part 1 - bank clients categorisation        | In this project we continue with machine learning categorisation task. We as analytics of commercial bank need to build most accurate model that will say if you can expect a client to leave a bank or not. | `sklearn` |
|6  |Machine learning part 2 - oil wells regression and bootstrap | Now we work for the oil production company. We need to decide where to drill the new well. | `sklearn` |
|7  |Machine learning part 3 - gold processing regression         | Here we have to prepare a prototype machine learning model for Digits company. The company develops solutions for the efficient operation of industrial enterprises. The model should predict the recovery rate of gold from a gold-bearing ore. | `sklearn` |
|8  |Machine learning part 4 - forecasting time series            | We use machine learning to forecast demand for taxi services in the upcoming hours based on cyclicality of orders. | `statsmodels.tsa.seasonal`, `catboost`, `lightgbm`, `sklearn` |
|9  |Machine learning part 5 - natural language processing        | In this project we use simple natural language processing techniques as tf-idf to determine if exact comment contains "toxic" words or not and then classify it. | `nltk`, `lightgbm `, `sklearn` |
|10 |Data extraction and visualization - mini, without SQL        | We use SQL queries to drag data about number of flights (and other statistics) during music festivals. Secondly in python we use simple visualization of data we get from SQL. | `SQL`, `seaborn` |
|11 | Computer vision                                             | Now we perform a deep learning machine learning with ResNet50 architecture to run a regression model of defining persons age based on their photoe. | `tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image`, `tensorflow.keras.layers`, `tensorflow.keras.optimizers`, `tensorflow.keras.applications.resnet`, `tensorflow.keras.models` |
