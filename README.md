# ya.praktikum

Hello and thank you for entering my repository!

My name is Marat Zastavnichenko and I'm a (to be) Data Scientist
Here you can find some of the most interesting projects I made with the help of Yandex.Praktikum on-line school.

You will find the description of each project in Read-me file for the respective folder.
You can also notice that project folders are having numbering order - this is the order of projects becoming more complex.

Kind regards and have a good day!
